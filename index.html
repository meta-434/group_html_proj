				<h1>VT <br/>English </br> Club <br/></h1>
				<h2>Who we are</h2>
				<p>VT English Club is for students interested in English,whether that be writing or reading, to come together to make friends and share interests.
					We hope to encourage involvement in the department and the Blacksburg community. We also provide students the opportunity to meet and work with
					various faculty members throughout the department in various projects. Each month, we invite a professor or professors to a meeting to discuss
					their research and upcoming courses they'll be teaching. We also hold two annual events, the professor breakfast and trivia night, which gives
					students an opportunity to know their professors in a casual setting.</p>

					<p>The English Club plans to become involved with the NRV reading hour this upcoming year, as well as continue to participate in Trunk or Treat
						and the Angel Tree Program. Each spring, we also have our own team for The Big Event, as well as Relay for Life.</p>

						<p>Overall, our club's goal is also to create friendships, so we plan various excursions for our members to enjoy together.
							This year, we are planning on attending a play at the American Shakespeare Center and visiting the Green Valley Book Fair.<br><br>
							The English Club also works in partnership with the English Honor Society, Sigma Tau Delta.</p>

								<h1>Book of the Month</h1>

								<h2>November</h2>
								<h3>The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern</h3>
								<blockquote>"Will insert quote here soon."–Rachel Hargrave, English Club Member</blockquote>

								<h2>October</h2>
								<h3>A Moveable Feast by Ernest Hemingway</h3>
								<blockquote>
									“Rarely are readers allowed into into the mind of a literary genius, making this peek into thoughts of a young Ernest Hemingway by his older self, unmissable. Studded with a constellation of the brightest stars in the Modernist era, the book is filled with the brightness of a roaring, lost Paris reborn after a World War but tinted with the foreknowledge of the older, authorial voice. Hemingway is at his best when writing what he knows, and he certainly knows himself.
									As the title suggests, the novel is written in easily digested vignettes: a feast of words. It’s perfect for reading while waiting for the bus or in between classes.” –Amelia Dirks, Vice President of the English Club
